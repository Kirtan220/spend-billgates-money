## How to Use

1. **Buy Items:** Click the "Buy" button next to an item to increase its quantity and reduce the balance.

- Buying an item deducts its price from your balance.
- If your balance is lower than the item’s price, the "Buy" button will be disabled.

2. **Sell Items:** Click the "Sell" button to decrease the item quantity and add its price back to the balance.

- Selling an item is only allowed if you have previously bought it.

3. **View Receipt:** The receipt section shows a list of purchased items, their quantities, individual costs, and the total amount spent.
